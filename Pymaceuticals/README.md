# Pymaceuticals Analysis

Over the course of 45 days, this study analyzed the effects of a placebo and a range of nine drug treatment regimens on the tumor development of 248 mice suffering from a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  The most promising treatments in this range included Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ramicane, and this company’s drug of interest, Capomulin.  The ultimate purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin against the other drug candidates.

A superficial analysis of this study yields some interesting observations concerning the efficacy of the top four drugs.  Except for Ramicane with its symmetrical tumor volume distribution, all the treatment regimens have skewed distributions towards the low end indicated by a margin between the median and mean below.  Moreover, Ramicane and Capomulin have the narrowest distributions while Ceftamin’s is the widest, about as wide as the placebo’s, followed by Infubinol.  Generally, the narrower distributions with their lower variances infer a consistency in outcomes.  On top of that, Ramicane and Capomulin have the lowest median tumor volumes; Ceftamin and Infubinol have the same median, which is noticeably higher and comparable to the placebo’s value.  What’s more, Capomulin’s mouse weight and tumor volume metrics have a very strong relationship evidenced by a 0.842 linear correlation.

Unfortunately, upon closer examination, there are serious anomalies in this study’s data collection and quality control.  For instance, Infubinol’s distribution has a single statistically insignificant low outlier: inexplicably, one of only two data points from a single mouse in a study where each mouse should have ten data points.  Further investigation reveals that Ramicane and Capomulin have 22-29% more data points than the other treatment regimens except for Propriva where the difference grows to 55%.  This discrepancy comes from the number of data points per mouse: each candidate has about 25 mice for its trial, however, unlike the others who have fewer, Ramicane’s and Capomulin’s mice overwhelmingly have ten data points.  This situation begs the question: would comparable numbers of data points per mouse change the outcomes?  Would more data points for all the candidates?  Furthermore, the original number of mice was 249, but one mouse had duplicate timepoints with suspiciously different tumor volumes.  

Ostensibly, Ramicane is the most promising drug with Capomulin a close second, and neither Ceftamin nor Infubinol have any discernable effect on decreasing tumor volume.  In truth, this study should be invalidated due to asymmetrical data collection, inconsistencies, and insufficient sample spaces.  Therefore, I recommend another study of these treatments where each mouse provides ten data points for analysis, the number of mice per trial increases from 25 to 100, the weight of each mouse in the study is approximately the same, and clinical trial managers review data for inconsistencies immediately after collection.   Once a decision based on a valid and accurate study is forthcoming, the company can begin investigating the best possible dosage of Capomulin, or any other treatment for SCC, based on a subject’s weight.
