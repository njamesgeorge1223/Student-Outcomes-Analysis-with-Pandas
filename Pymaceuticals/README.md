# Pymaceuticals Analysis

Over the course of 45 days, this study analyzed the effects of a placebo and a range of drug treatment regimens on the tumor development of 248 mice with a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma; the range included Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ramicane, and this company’s drug of interest, Capomulin.  Furthermore, the original number of mice was 249, but one mouse had duplicate timepoints with suspiciously different tumor volumes.  The study’s purpose was to compare the performance of Capomulin against the other drug candidates.

The analysis of this study yields compelling observations concerning the efficacy of these drugs.  Except for Ramicane with its symmetrical tumor volume distribution, all the treatment regimens have skewed distributions towards the low end indicated by a margin between the median and mean below.  Moreover, Ramicane and Capomulin have the narrowest distributions while Ceftamin’s is the widest, about as wide as the placebo’s.  In particular, the narrower distributions with their lower variances infer a consistency in their outcomes.  Infubinol’s distribution is also wide and has a single statistically insignificant low outlier: inexplicably, the only data point from a single mouse in a study where each mouse should have ten data points.  On top of that, Ramicane has the lowest median tumor volume followed closely by Capomulin; Ceftamin and Infubinol have the same median, which is noticeably higher than their competitors and comparable to the placebo’s value.  What’s more, Capomulin’s mouse weight and tumor volume metrics have a very strong relationship evidenced by a 0.842 linear correlation.

Overall, Ramicane is the most promising drug with Capomulin a close second; neither Ceftamin nor Infubinol have any discernable effect on decreasing tumor volume.  Assuming that drug dosages are uniform in the study, the company might increase the benefits of Capomulin by varying dosage based on weight.  Therefore, I recommend an additional study to discover if increasing Capomulin dosage for higher mouse weights leads to better results.
